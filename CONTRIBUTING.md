# Contributing to Release Draft
Feel free to:

- Report a bug

## I Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes. To submit a change:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue a pull request

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/crs-k/release-draft/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/crs-k/release-draft/issues/new).
